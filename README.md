# ssup - upload screenshot

## Directions (MacOS)

1. Edit two lines in ssup to configure the upload command and the URL.  (This
   is only necessary before the first time you use it, or when the upload or
   URL info changes.)

2. Take a screenshot with command+control+shift+4,so the screenshot is in the
   clipboard

2. Run ssup to upload the image in the clipboard.

3. Wait for ssup to finish. (It says "image uploaded" with text-to-speech
   when it's done.)

4. The URL of the uploaded image is in your clipboard.
