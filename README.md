# ssup - upload screenshot (MacOS)

## Initial configuration

Before you use ssup for the first time, edit two lines in ssup to configure the
upload command and the URL.

## Directions

1. Take a screenshot with command+control+shift+4, so the screenshot is in the
   clipboard.

2. Run ssup to upload the image in the clipboard.

3. Wait for ssup to finish. (It says "image uploaded" with text-to-speech
   when it's done.)

4. The URL of the uploaded image is in your clipboard.
